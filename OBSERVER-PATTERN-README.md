We’re building an application for watching the price of various 
stocks. There are two places in our application where we need to 
display the stocks: 
- StatusBar: shows the popular stocks 
- StockListView: shows the complete list of stocks 
When the price of a stock changes, the corresponding views 
(StatusBar and/or StockListView) need to be refreshed to reflect the 
latest price. 
Our application currently does not have the ability to communicate 
the change in stock prices to the corresponding views.
